# ProceduralGenerationLibrary

This project, Procedural Generation Toolkit, is a Python-based library designed to facilitate the creation of procedurally generated content. It leverages various Python libraries such as Noise, Pillow, NumPy, SciPy, and OpenSimplex to generate diverse and complex patterns, landscapes, and textures. This toolkit is ideal for game developers, artists, and anyone interested in exploring the creative potential of procedural generation.

## Installation

To install the Procedural Generation Toolkit, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/procedural-generation-toolkit.git
cd procedural-generation-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the toolkit to generate a simple noise pattern:

```python
from procedural_gen import SimplexNoiseGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

generator = SimplexNoiseGenerator()
pattern = generator.generate_noise(100, 100)

plt.imshow(pattern, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

For more detailed examples, please refer to the `examples` directory.
